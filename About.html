    - Exceptional Food & Service - Miffcolby via TripAdvisor -<br><br>
    "Stumbled across Dine Divine by chance, while driving through Sassafras. What a find!! The quality of food, service &
    value were all excellent. When explaining my partner was gluten intolerant, they were very understanding and
    accommodating, ensuring all dishes were the ones I could eat. Will definitely return on our next visit to Victoria."<br><br>
